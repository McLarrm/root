 * main - Hello, I'm Olajide. I recently joined the ALX Software Engineering Programme with no previous experience and this is the very first project.
 * I decided to add this to my repository to reflect on my Software Engineering Journey In the future.
 * So far I've learnt shell and myriad of text editors ranging from Emacs, Vi, Vim etc.
 * We are currenclty in C Programming, C is fun but really difficult but it's really been interesting learning the language.
 * I'll keep this updated as my journey as a Software Engineer progresses.
 * Cheerio !!
